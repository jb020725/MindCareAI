‚úÖ What I have done in this project (MindCareAI):
Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TypeScript)

Created a ChatGPT-style UI with:

Input box, send button, chat history, assistant name

Responsive design + dark mode styling in App.css

Frontend connected to backend using Axios in api.ts

Developed main chat functionality in App.tsx

Backend Setup (FastAPI + Gemini API)

Structured backend with:

main.py: FastAPI app with CORS setup

routers/chat.py: /chat endpoint

services/gemini_service.py: function to call real Gemini API

Installed and used google-generativeai for official Gemini integration

Loaded Gemini API key from .env file

Fixed errors with async/await and correct Gemini model names

Tested End-to-End

Able to chat with Gemini 1.5 Pro model

Observed limitations: repetition, shallow responses, hallucinations, over-triggering of mental health flags

üéØ What I want to do next:
Make MindCare Assistant respond more thoughtfully

Avoid shallow responses like jumping to medical advice too soon

Ask follow-up questions step-by-step (like a real listener)

Slow down to clarify emotional state before offering resources

Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Use trusted public psychology and mental health content as context

Examples: WHO, NIMH, CBT guides, self-help PDFs

Process ‚Üí Chunk ‚Üí Embed ‚Üí Store in FAISS

Retrieve relevant chunks for Gemini prompt input

Improve prompt structure for Gemini

Give system instructions like:
‚ÄúYou are a supportive assistant that helps with emotional stress, not diagnosis. Use factual information. Ask one question at a time.‚Äù

Eventually add more avatars and voice support

But right now: focus on making the default assistant intelligent and safe
